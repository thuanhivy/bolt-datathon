Bolt UBC Bootcamp 2024 Datathon
- The shift towards cashless transactions has sparked a critical need for payment solutions that are not only secure but also efficient and sustainable.
- The bank is currently wrestling with increased digital transactions, sophisticated cyber threats, and changing consumer habits – all of which have led to more false alarms, rising operational costs, and a risk to customer trust.
- Our task is to design a solution that reduces fraud, cuts down on false positives, and cements NullFraud Bank’s reputation as a pioneer in secure transactions.
- We developed a machine learning model (Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Random Forest,...) using R language to spot the risk of potential fraud and balance fraud detection accuracy against false positives. 
- We visualized daily transactions patterns using Microsoft Excel to spot fraud losses and recommended solutions to improve customer satisfaction. 
- Selected to the semi-final round and placed at Top 20.
